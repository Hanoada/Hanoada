<h1>Hi, I'm Adam!</h1>

I am a Computer Science student at Western Governors University and I'm planning to graduate with a bachelor's degree on April 1, 2023... and I can't wait!

Life is busy and I love it. Right now, I get to be a:
- Full-Time Student
- Full-Time Self-Employed Contractor
- Full-Time Dad & Husband

I feel very fortunate to have access to the learning resources available in this modern age and always look forward to learning more.

One of the reasons I like programming is because of the hardware behind it. Ever since I was a little kid, I found it absolutely, mind-bogglingly incredible that you can send electricity to tiny components to do millions > billions > trillions??? of things per second!

After learning a bit more about how electricity works, the "magic" became even more alluring. It turns out we aren't just pumping electrons from the power station to our homes like a garden hose. Who knew? Certainly not me as a child!

The spark inside my mind to learn more about computers eventually led me to Western Governors University, where I am about to complete my Computer Science degree. Learning languages like C++, SQL, Java, AIML, and Python have been exciting and truly interesting. Knowing a little bit about what's underneath the languages (compilers, CPUs) has been a joy and a journey.

While the projects on my GitHub account aren't multi-billion-dollar projects, they are the result of countless hours of learning and dedication during nights and weekends.

I look forward to my next step into this big world as a Computer Science graduate. The idea of pursuing a career in this field seems almost too good to be true! As always, I promise to do my best to improve over time and gain a deeper understanding of these miraculous little machines that are involved in nearly every aspect of our daily lives. 

Adam
